# BOID-Based-Movement-System

Project to create an efficient large scale movement system with many actors using unity's DOTS system. At its current efficiency including rendering the sprites it can run at 150 fps using an intel i5 Haswell 4690k processor and a GTX 1080 graphics card. The CPU is by far the limiting factor, for the movement and distance calculations every fram, with minimal graphics card usage.
